Its main product candidate is Relugolix. Relugolix is an oral, once-daily, small molecule that acts as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that binds to and inhibits receptors in the anterior pituitary gland. Inhibition of GnRH receptors decreases the release of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone, or LH, and follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH, thereby decreasing the down-stream production of estrogen and progesterone by the ovaries in women and testosterone by the testes in men. It is advancing relugolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, endometriosis-associated pain and prostate cancer. It intends to develop its second product candidate, RVT-602, for the treatment of female infertility as part of assisted reproduction. ",
