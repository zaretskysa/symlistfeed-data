        "Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused primarily on the development of therapies to treat prevalent inflammatory conditions for which there are limited treatment options. The Company's two lead product candidates in development are Ampion for osteoarthritis of the knee and Optina for diabetic macular edema. Ampion is a sub 5000 molecular weight fraction of commercial human serum albumin (HSA). Optina is a low-dose formulation of danazol. The Ampio segment consists of its biopharmaceuticals compounds and the clinical trials associated with them. The Company is primarily developing compounds that decrease inflammation by inhibiting specific pro-inflammatory compounds by affecting specific pathways at the protein expression and at the transcription level; activating specific phosphatase or depleting available phosphate needed for the inflammation process, and decreasing vascular permeability.",
