        "AirXpanders, Inc. (AirXpanders) is a medical device company. The Company is engaged in developing initial product technology, recruiting personnel and raising capital. AirXpanders focuses on the field of tissue expansion after mastectomy, with an emphasis on breast reconstruction. The Company is designing the AeroForm patient controlled tissue expander. The AeroForm system consists of a self-contained expander (which is implanted in a similar manner to traditional saline expanders following a mastectomy), and a small hand-held wireless remote control unit. The lipstick-sized carbon dioxide (CO2) reservoir in the expander gradually releases a predetermined amount of CO2 through a small internal valve, eliminating the need for frequent saline injections at doctors' offices typically associated with on-market expanders.",

Its Cymerus technology facilitates manufacture of MSCs from a single donor and a single donation. The Company's Cymerus platform stem cell technology is based upon stem cells known as mesenchymoangioblasts (MCAs). The Company's technology utilizes induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) originating from an adult donor as the starting material for generating MCAs and in turn for manufacturing the MSC therapeutic product. The Cymerus platform provides a source of MSCs that is independent of donor limitations and provides an off-the-shelf stem cell platform for therapeutic product use. The Company's MSCs produced using Cymerus technology, can be used to treat unrelated patients, without any need to match the recipient to the donor.",

It consists of approximately 100% control of over 10 million ounce gold deposit, with an inferred mineral resource of approximately 25 million tons at over 14 grams per ton gold and approximately 620,000 ounces of gold in the probable ore reserve. Its mineral tenure covers an area of over 1,000 square kilometers (100,000 hectares). The core of the mineral tenure with an area of approximately 148 square kilometers consists of over five east-west Reef Structures. Reef Structure 1 includes gold production from the approximately 10 mines, including the Brilliant, Day Dawn and Queen.",

Mesmer provides security measures to allow prison authorities to enforce perimeters to prevent the use of drones to deliver contraband. Mesmer prevents drones from penetrating perimeters, alerts the authorities and lands the drone in a secured space for subsequent recovery and investigation. In contrast to other systems, MESMER does not employ kinetic attacks or jamming. MESMER's detection stage occurs using cognitive techniques for blind signal detection and characterization to determine the existence of threats. MESMER's response stage is based on a technique called protocol manipulation.",

        "Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) is an Australia-based uranium producer. The Company operates the Ranger uranium mine in Northern Territory of Australia. It operates through the Uranium segment. ERA sells its product to international power utilities. The Company's Ranger mine is located approximately eight kilometers east of Jabiru and over 260 kilometers east of Darwin. The mine lies within the 79-square kilometer Ranger Project Area. Its Ranger mine produces approximately 120,000 tons of uranium oxide (U3O8). The Company also holds interest in Jabiluka Mineral Lease, which is approximately 20 kilometers north of the existing Ranger facilities. The Ranger 3 Deeps project involved the construction of a 2,710-meter Exploration Decline and an associated underground exploration-drilling programmer designed to pave the way to a potential underground mine. The Company's operations rely on the processing of uranium ore stockpiles following cessation of open pit mining of Pit 3.",

The Company's Bisantrene drug is a chemotherapy drug, which is related to the anthracyclines, a class of drugs used as the first line of treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers. Its Bisantrene drug reduces cardiac toxicity compared to anthracyclines and to be effective against some cancers that have relapsed after the patients have already received high levels of anthracyclines, which makes Bisantrene as a second- or third-line treatment for patients reaching their cardio-toxic limit of anthracyclines or whose cancer has become resistant to anthracycline treatment. It has received orphan drug designation for Bisantrene in the United States. Its clinical opportunity for Bisantrene is used as a salvage treatment for elderly patients with AML.",

The Company focuses on the development and commercialization of oncolytic immunotherapies that harness the power of certain viruses to preferentially infect and kill cancer cells. The principal activity of the Company is clinical and preclinical development of its lead product, CAVATAK. CAVATAK is a formulation of the common cold Coxsackievirus Type A21. CAVATAK binds to specific receptor proteins expressed on a range of tumor cell types, and acts to destroy local, as well as metastatic cancer cells through cell lysis and the generation of a specific immune response against the cancer cells. CAVATAK is a naturally occurring, genetically unaltered virus with activity in a range of cancer types, including, but not limited to melanoma, prostate, lung, and bladder cancers. CAVATAK is being evaluated in Phase I and II clinical trials, both as an intratumoural and intravenous agent.",
