The cassette captures CTCs based on their less deformable nature and larger size compared to other blood components. The resulting liquid biopsy (blood test) enables the detection and investigation of mutations in the patient's cancer for personalized cancer care. The harvested CTCs have a range of applications, including diagnosis, prognosis, mutational analysis and drug selection, drug development, assessment of treatment effectiveness and remission monitoring.",

Its platform generates a range of drug-like, synthesizable compounds, which are then computationally tested against a disease-causing protein to identify the binders, the drug candidates that could potentially treat the disease. These computationally designed candidates are synthesized and sent through a series of disease specific in vitro and in vivo tests to identify the candidates for clinical testing in humans. Its anticoagulant candidates are potent and selective direct thrombin inhibitors that bind to thrombin through reversible, covalent inhibition.",
